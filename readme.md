#Summary
This map is ver 1.0 of this map and my final for GHY 4818 Web Mapping. It is a multilayer map depicting a rash of earthquakes in Iceland from 10/09 to 11/19 where they experienced close to 20,000 earthquake in that time.

#Interactivity
Bedrock Geology has highlightable features. When user clicks on the polygon the epoch it was formed and how many millions of years ago that was is displayed.
The "Week" layers show the quakes. When the user hovers on the points the time/date, the magnitude, and the depth is displayed.

#Future Updates:
1. Styling changes to the layer controls to fit with the theme.
2. Info box that will contain section text.
3. Earthquake data display change where magnitude is differentiated by color and depth differentiated by radius size.
4. Possible legend that tells the number of quakes displayed on screen, the gradiated colors of magnitude, and radius size in relation to depth.
5. Sparsing of data to remove any insignificant quakes less < 1.0 magnitude.
